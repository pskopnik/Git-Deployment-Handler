# Configuration of a local repository containing a puppet module.
# Deployment is done via cron job due to the lack of permissions of the
# gitolite user (which is used to execute the post-receive hook).
# Commits are stored in a local MongoDB database.
# Internal git files, i.e. the .git/ directory, ..., are not removed after
# deployment so it will be possible to inspect code changes manually at
# any point in time.
#
# Install post-receive hook with `git-dh install postreceive CONFFILE`
# Install cron job with `git-dh install cron CRONJOBNAME CONFFILE`
# Ensure the cron job user has the necessary permissions to write to the
# deployment directory.
